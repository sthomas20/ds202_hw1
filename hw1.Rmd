**Question 3:**
One job that I think is related to data science is a **Data Scientist**. Data science itselfs involves a lot *statistics*, *data analysis*, *machine learning*, and more. Data scientists use these types of methods in their field to solve real world problems and in order to understand and analyze the meaning of the data they are working with.
