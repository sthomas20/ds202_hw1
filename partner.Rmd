## Parner File

Partner Name: John Nownes

Partner GitHub username: jnownes

The owner added hw1.Rmd and hw1.html in their most recent commit.

Commit ID: a6d28cb

At first, I was not able to knit Sonia (the owner's) hw1.Rmd. The error was the image that she used in hw1.Rmd came from her local computer, not a link to an online image.

After Sonia added the image to her local git repo and committed it to GitHub, I was able to repull the repo onto my local machine. Then, I was able to successfully knit Sonia's hw1.Rmd file.

One tip to make GitHub easier would be to commit as often as possible, because then your partner has the most current files.
